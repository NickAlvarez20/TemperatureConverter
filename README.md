## Project Name
Temperature Converter
## About
This project is a simple command-line temperature conversion tool written in Go. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit by providing a temperature value and unit, with formatted output for easy reading.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Go installed on your system. No additional libraries are required, as the program uses only the standard fmt package.
Determine is additional libraries are required or no additional libraries
## Features
This TemperatureConverter project includes these features:

-Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit

-Convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius

-Input validation for temperature units (C/c or F/f)

-Formatted output with two decimal places for precision

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/TemperatureConverter.git`
## Usage
Run the Go script (main.go) from the command line:

`go run main.go`

Follow the prompts to enter a temperature value and unit (C or F). Example:

-Enter temperature value: 32

-Enter C or F: F

-32.00 F is 0.00 C

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand Go's syntax and basic programming constructs

-Implement functions with input validation and string formatting

-Enhance problem-solving skills through practical application
